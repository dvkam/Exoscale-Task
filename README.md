# Write a Java program which is doing the following:

1. Create any Exoscale Instance using Exoscale API V2 ([https://openapi-v2.exoscale.com/](https://openapi-v2.exoscale.com/ "https://openapi-v2.exoscale.com/"))

2. Use cloud-init to install docker and a webserver container on this instance during deployment.

Result should be that the website from the container is reachable from the internet (we donâ€™t care about the website).
